## Modelling of knowledge and the cyber-physical systems

February 5 - February 9, 2018
Champéry, Switzerland


### Overview

This Winter School presents in the form of tutorials (for non-specialists) the various principles and techniques for the modelling of knowledge and the cyber-physical systems.
Although these two domains are distinct as research themes, we would like to show that they are complementary and that they can be inspired from each other. The presenters , 
who are renowned  researchers in their respective fields will present among other topics, formal techniques for modelling cyber-physical systems and techniques and tools for knowledge engineering.

Furthermore, student participants are asked to bring a poster of their research work, either existing results or ongoing research that they are currently conducting.

### Program

Student participants are asked to bring a poster of their research work, either existing results or ongoing research that they are currently conducting. Further instructions of how their work will be showcased during the Winter School will be sent by email to everyone closer to the event.
Programme

The program includes presentations by three speakers:

* **Cyber Physical Systems (H. Vangheluwe)**
  * Causal Block Diagrams syntax and semantics (in enough detail to build one's own Simulink-like simulator ... and code generator)
    * Algebraic Causal Block Diagrams (denotational and operational), loop detection and solving.
    * Discrete-Time Causal Block Diagrams
    * Continuous-Time Causal Block Diagrams (denotational, translational semantics approximation)
  * PID controllers (in CBDs)
    *shooting problems, optimization and deployment of controllers
  * Statecharts to model timed, autonomous and reactive systems at a discrete-event abstraction level
  * Modelling Language Engineering:  to introduce syntax and semantics of languages,

* **Ontology engineering (O. Corcho)**
  * Ontology engineering: ontological languages, types of ontologies and their use
  * Methodologies for designing ontologies, supporting tools
  * Ontology-based software engineering, ontology-based applications

* **Semantic Web engineering (R. Verborgh)**
  * Introduction to the Semantic Web and linked data
  * Software engineering for the Semantic Web
  * Hands-on sessions on the development of ontology-based Semantic Web applications

### Speakers

* **Prof. Hans Vangheluwe**, University of Antwerp, Belgium /University of McGill, Canada

  Hans Vangheluwe is interested in the modelling and simulation based analysis and design of complex, cyber-physical systems. In the  Modelling, Simulation and Design Lab (MSDL) and AnSyMo Lab, he is studying with his team the theory of Multi-Paradigm Modelling (MPM) and build tools to support the design and implementation of such complex systems. The MSDL is part of the School of Computer Science of McGill University in Montréal, Québec, Canada and of the AnSyMo (Antwerp Systems and software Modelling) group in the department of Mathematics and Computer Science of the University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium. The MSDL has projects, researchers and students in both locations. 

  Professor Vangheluwe will present formalisms needed to study cyber-physical systems: Causal Block Diagrams, Statecharts, Petri Nets. The CBDs and Statecharts allow to explain, after a short introduction to control theory (PID controllers), how to model, simulate, optimize, and finally, deploy a controller for example, an autonomous vehicle. 

* **Oscar Corcho** is a full Professor at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid (UPM) where he is leading a team of 15 people (including post-docs, PhD students and software engineers) at the Ontology Engineering Group. 
 He co-founded LocaliData in 2013, a spin-off that aims at obtaining added value from the combination of open and closed data in the context of medium and large smart cities (http://www.localidata.com/). 

  His work is mainly focused on applied research in the areas of Linked Data, Semantic e-Science and the Real World Internet. He also has wide experience in Ontology Engineering. In these areas, he has participated, and led, a number of EU and Spanish R&D projects, together with other knowledge-transfer projects funded by international companies and public organisations. 
 I am also teaching one of the courses at the Master on Business Analytics and Big Data at Instituto de Empresa (http://mbd.ie.edu/), and have taught several courses on Open Data for civil servants, city information managers and data reusers. Previously, I worked as a Marie Curie research fellow at the University of Manchester, and as a research manager at iSOCO. I also took part in LikeCube, a startup working on personalised recommendation that was acquired by TimeOut in July 2011. 

  He is an expert in Linked Data, SPARQL, RDF, Ontologies, data streams, e-Science, R&D management


* **Ruben Verborgh** is a postdoctoral researcher in Semantic Hypermedia at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Ghent University. He  explores the connection between Semantic Web technologies and the Web's architectural properties, with the ultimate goal of building more intelligent clients. He is a recognised specialist of Linked Data, REST/hypermedia, Web APIs, and related technologies. He's a co-author of two books on Linked Data, and has contributed to more than 140 publications on Web-related topics for international conferences and journals.
